It helps me stay active, improves my focus, and gives me a sense of joy and relaxation. Overall, cricket is more than just a hobby for me—it’s something that truly inspires and energizes me</p>
        <p>Reading books is one of my favorite hobbies because it opens the door to new ideas, experiences, and worlds. It helps me expand my knowledge, improve my imagination, and develop a deeper understanding of different people and cultures. Whether I’m reading fiction for enjoyment or non-fiction to learn something new, books always give me a sense of relaxation and inspiration. This hobby not only sharpens my mind but also provides a peaceful escape from everyday life</p>
        <P>Drawing is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to express my thoughts and feelings in a creative way. With just a pencil and paper, I can turn my imagination into something visible and meaningful. Whether I’m sketching objects, people, or ideas from my mind, drawing helps me improve my focus and patience. It also gives me a sense of satisfaction when I see my artwork come to life.</P>    <h1>My Favourite things</h1>

             <dd>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players each on a large field, centered around a 22-yard-long pitch. One team bats, trying to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the other team bowls and fields, trying to prevent runs and get the batters out. After both teams take turns batting and bowling, the team with the most runs wins.</dd>
